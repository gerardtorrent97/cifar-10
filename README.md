# Description

Image classification with the CIFAR10 dataset (included in Keras). 

- Dataset of 50,000 images for training and 10,000 for testing.
- RGB images (32x32 pixels).
- Images labeled in 10 different classes.

# Goals

- Test 10 different neural networks combinations.
- Collect the results and analyze them.
- Give an overall comparison between the 10 projects.
- Beat the 80% accuracy benchmark.
